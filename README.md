# Mongo index exporter

Having correct and effective indexes is very important. As your system grows
you might want to update indexes to increase performance of your db.
You would probably need to start with exporting current indexes.

I have created this utility to simplify this process.

## Usage

This utility can be used as a command-line tool and also as a node module
(see [sample](https://github.com/martinerko/mongo-index-exporter/tree/master/sample) folder).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g mongo-index-exporter
```

## CLI

Command-line version is provided with help that will tell you everything you
might need:

```sh
mongo-index-exporter  --help
```

Basic usage:

```sh
mongo-index-exporter localhost:27017/test
```

Usage with authentication:

```sh
mongo-index-exporter localhost:27017/test -u john -p s3ecr3t
```

```sh
mongo-index-exporter localhost:27017/test --username superuser --password T0pS3ecr3t --authenticationDatabase admin
```

### Output

CLI version outputs index definitions in a format that you can immediately use
to instantiate your database indexes:

```sh
// library.books
db.library.books.createIndex({"_id":1}, {"name":"_id_"});
db.library.books.createIndex({"author.name":1}, {"name":"author.name_1"});
db.library.books.createIndex({"genre":1}, {"name":"genre_1"});
db.library.books.createIndex({"title":1,"author.name":1}, {"name":"title_1_author.name_1"});

// library.genres
db.library.genres.createIndex({"_id":1}, {"name":"_id_"});
db.library.genres.createIndex({"title":1}, {"unique":true,"name":"title_1"});
```

- with `--createCollectionCMD` args

When you add `--createCollectionCMD` args, it will add create collection cmd to the output for each collection

```sh
// library.books
db.createCollection("library.books");
db.library.books.createIndex({"author.name":1}, {"name":"author.name_1"});
db.library.books.createIndex({"genre":1}, {"name":"genre_1"});
db.library.books.createIndex({"title":1,"author.name":1}, {"name":"title_1_author.name_1"});

// library.genres
db.createCollection("library.genres");
db.library.genres.createIndex({"title":1}, {"unique":true,"name":"title_1"});
```

## Full workflow

1. Use [mongo-index-exporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-index-exporter) to extract indexes from your database:

```sh
mongo-index-exporter localhost:27017/test > indexesForReview.txt
```

2. Manually review and update index definitions (reviewedIndexes.txt).

3. Import them into database:

```sh
cat reviewedIndexes.txt | mongo localhost:27017/test
```

4. Use [mongo-index-reviewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongo-index-reviewer) to compare reviewed indexes with those in database:

```sh
mongo-index-reviewer localhost:27017/test --indexFile ./reviewedIndexes.txt > outstandingIndexes.txt
```

5. Remove outstanding indexes from your database:

```sh
cat outstandingIndexes.txt | mongo localhost:27017/test
```
